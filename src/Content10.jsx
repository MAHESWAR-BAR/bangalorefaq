          No, we do not. RaphaCure is an aggregator of ambulances and works with
          multiple private ambulance providers pan India. We, therefore,
          dispatch the nearest ambulance to you each time a request is received.{" "}

        <p>
          Our ambulance shall reach the location within 20-25 minutes based on
          normal circumstances. For ambulances, the time taken is between 30-45
          minutes as the driver/ambulance/ ambulance attendant will need to be
          geared up in protective gear. Note that the ambulances are arranged on
          a best-efforts basis and we do not take any liability for delays due
          to any unforeseen circumstances.{" "}
