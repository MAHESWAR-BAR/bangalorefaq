        <p>
          An experienced and qualiÔ¨Åed doctor can still diagnose common
          non-urgent illnesses faced by the patient during a video consultation.
          They typically do so by assessing your history, current symptoms and
          by talking with you. <br></br>In case the doctor thinks that your
          condition requires further investigation, you may be advised a
          physical consultation or further investigative tests
